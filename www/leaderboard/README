How to use this?

1) Run the simple embedded python web server:
   $ python leaderboard-server.py

2) Point a browser at http://localhost:12084/leaderboard.html

3) Change the data/leaderboard.txt file and place images in data/ subdir.

image is expected to be 500x400 currently....we can change this.

imagemagick can simply do the image stuff:
mogrify -resize 500x400^ -gravity center -extent 500x400 -colorspace gray -colors 2 -normalize * 
(and of course this is tweakable)

leaderboard file format:

Each line has 3 comma delimited fields:
initials,score,image filename

The file should have the most recent entry at the top of the file, with later
dated entries following below.  The "latest" entry being at the top allows us to 
immediately show the last hero upon file update.

leaderboard file notes:
* The entries do not have to be sorted by score but will be displayed that way in the leaderboard.
* Remember that initials are not unique -- I recommend using some hash of the camera file 
  when naming the files.
* The image file should be written before the leaderboard file is written.
* I recommend we backup/version every instance of the leaderboard.txt (which should correspond to each game end)
